# my-first-blog
This is the Basic Blogging site using Django Framework. This project is intended to implement what I learned. This basically does **CRUD**
Operations. 

It has User authentication. Which means It's just a Viewers site. They can only view my blogs but cannot login.
It has **Comment system**.

As a Blogger, I can Create, Read, Update, and Delete my Blog if i want to.

**Known Bugs**
